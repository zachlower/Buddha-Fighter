You've done well, my pupil. You are
one step closer to Enlightenment.
;I will open my garden gate
for you to pass.
;Now go to the temple 
and visit my teacher.
;His name is Laozi, he 
can teach you more.
;You will find him if 
you follow the path.
;But before you leave, why don't 
you spendsome time smelling 
my lovely flowers?
